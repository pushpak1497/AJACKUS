# User Management ReactJS Project

## What is the use of this Repo

This project is a simple **User Management** application built with **ReactJS** and **Vite**. It demonstrates the following:

1. Creating React components with functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
2. Making HTTP API calls to fetch, add, update, and delete user data.
3. Communicating between parent and child components.
4. Using a form for adding and editing user information.
5. Styling the application using **Tailwind CSS**.
6. Managing the list of users and their details.

This template can be extended to build more complex applications with similar user management functionalities.
